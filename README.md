# VLAReplica

__For full setup instructions with pictures and videos, refer to the [setup docs](https://irvlutd.github.io/VLAReplica/setup-docs/).__

## Repository setup

VLA-REPLICA utilizes a simple Python script for benchmarking as well as the LeRobot library for SO-101 control. 

GPU VRAM usage is heavy during inference, especially for more complex VLAs like pi0.5, so a GPU with at least 24GB VRAM is recommended.

Clone the repository, create a new virtual environment (recommended) and install prequisites listed in the ```environments.yml``` file:

```
git clone https://github.com/IRVLUTD/VLAReplica.git
cd VLAReplica
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate vlareplica
```

## Detect camera and USB indices

Since the camera indices on every computer can vary, utilize leRobot's find-cameras command to list out the corresponding index numbers for the RealSense and Vinmooog cameras (run in terminal):
```
lerobot-find-cameras
```
Record the camera indices for two cameras.

Since the USB serial port on every computer can vary, utilize leRobot's find-port command to list out the corresponding serial port of the SO-101 follower arm. Run the following command in a terminal:
```
lerobot-find-port
```
and then unplug the SO-101 USB cable from the computer, and then press ```Enter```. 

The terminal will output something like: ```Device port: /dev/ttyACM1```. 

Record the serial port (e.g. ```/dev/ttyACM1```) for the follower arm.

    Video 1: SO-101 Arm Calibration Procedure.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

1. Calibrate the SO-101 follower according to the [LeRobot Docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/so101?setup_motors=Command#calibrate). __Follow the video carefully, and ensure each motor is at the middle position before starting the calibration process.__ 
    * (*Note: This means for the wrist roll motor, the end-effector should be oriented so that the camera is rotated 90° and pointing towards the right side when looking at the end-effector head on*)
    * During calibration, thoroughly rotate each of the six motors to their physical joint limits. Don't forget any motors!

2. After calibration is complete, the ```calibration.json``` file is typically saved to ```~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/calibration/robots/<your-robot-id>``` in your root folder. Copy the generated calibration JSON file into `vlareplica/calibration/robots/so101_follower` inside your repo directory.
3. Rename it to `so101_follower_arm.json`.

## Camera Calibration

We first utilize an AprilTag mounted at a defined spot with respect to the box to allow general placement of the camera mount. Then, we utilize the idea of an *image overlay* to match the camera pose to the original VLA-Replica box camera pose as closely as possible.

### AprilTag calibration

1. In a new terminal inside the virtual environment, run the calibration script (replace your-top-camera-index with the number you recorded in __Software Installation__):

    ```python calibration/camera/detect_apriltag.py --camera-index <your-top camera-index>```
    
    A GUI window will pop up, displaying the live camera feed alongside the estimated AprilTag pose. 

    <figure style="text-align: center; margin: 20px auto;">

  </figcaption>
    </figure>

2. Reach inside the box and physically slide or tilt the camera mount along the PVC pipe until all reported values match the table below as close as possible (some error is acceptable):

    | X (m) | Y (m) | Z (m) | R (deg) | P (deg) | Y (deg) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | -0.06 ± 0.01 | -0.39 ± 0.01 | 1.25 ± 0.01 | -18.5 ± 1.0 | 3.0 ± 1.0 | 2.5 ± 1.0 |

    Once satisfied, press `q` to exit the program.

### Image Overlay Calibration

Although the AprilTag pose estimator may output values close to Table A.2, there may still be slight camera misalignment. To solve this, we utilize visual overlay matching (see below) to ensure the camera view is as close as possible to VLA-REPLICA’s original view.

</figure>

1. First, calibrate the top camera for the second time. Run the following (replacing `your-top-camera-id` with with the number you recorded in __Software Installation__): 
    ```python calibration/camera/overlay.py --overlay-image-folder calibration/camera/referenceImages/top --base-cam <your-top-camera-id>```

    A GUI window will pop up, overlaying the live top camera feed with a wrist view reference image. Match the view of your camera with the reference image by reaching into the box and sliding or tilting the camera mount along the PVC pipe.

2. Next, calibrate the wrist camera. Run the following (replacing `your-wrist-camera-id` with with the number you recorded in __Software Installation__): 
    ```python calibration/camera/overlay.py --overlay-image-folder calibration/camera/referenceImages/wrist --base-cam <your-wrist-camera-id>```

    A GUI window will pop up, overlaying the live wrist camera feed with a top view reference image. Slightly loosen the M3 screw on the wrist camera mount on the SO-101, and match the view of your camera with the reference image by rotating the camera mount along the end effector.

__Before the next step, ensure that:__

- All six pose values (x,y,z,R,P,Y) match the targets in the table:
    - | X (m) | Y (m) | Z (m) | R (deg) | P (deg) | Y (deg) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | -0.06 ± 0.01 | -0.39 ± 0.01 | 1.25 ± 0.01 | -18.5 ± 1.0 | 3.0 ± 1.0 | 2.5 ± 1.0 |
- Reference images and camera views match almost identically for both top and wrist cameras.

Congrats! The environment setup is complete, and you are ready to start benchmarking your VLA models!

## Training

Use the unified `train.sh` script to train any of the supported policies on either a single GPU or multiple GPUs. Make it executable once:

```
chmod +x train.sh
```

The script takes two positional arguments: `./train.sh <policy> [num_gpus]`. Supported policies are `act`, `smolvla`, `pi0`, `pi0_fast`, `pi05`, `dit`, `flow_matching_dit`, and `xvla`. `num_gpus` defaults to `1`.

```
# Single GPU
./train.sh pi0
./train.sh act

# Multi-GPU (second argument = number of GPUs; multi-GPU pi0 uses FSDP and requires fsdp_pi0.yaml in the same directory)
./train.sh pi0 4
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 ./train.sh smolvla 2

# Optional: enable wandb logging / push checkpoints to your own HF account
WANDB=true ./train.sh act 2
PUSH=true HF_USER=<your_hf_username> WANDB=true ./train.sh pi05 2
```

The following optional environment variables can be set to override defaults:

| Variable | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DATASET` | Dataset repo ID on the Hugging Face Hub | `HenryZhang/VLAReplica_SFT_data` |
| `OUTPUT_BASE` | Checkpoint/output directory | `./VLAReplica_outputs` |
| `WANDB` | Enable wandb logging (run `wandb login` first) | `false` |
| `PUSH` | Push checkpoints to **your** HF Hub | `false` |
| `HF_USER` | Your HF username/org for pushed repo IDs (required if `PUSH=true`) | *(none)* |
| `FSDP_CONFIG` | Accelerate FSDP yaml for multi-GPU pi0 | `./fsdp_pi0.yaml` |

> **Note:** single-GPU and multi-GPU modes keep the exact hyperparameters from the original validated scripts, so the same policy may use different settings (chunk size, batch size, steps, ...) depending on the mode.

## Evaluation script

Use the evaluation script `benchmark.py` to run a policy across predefined ID or OOD tasks, with predefined reference images. Refer to the table below for all CLI flags.

Currently, the script supports the following models: `{act,smolvla,dit,xvla,pi0,pi05,molmoact2}`. Support for other VLA models will arrive soon. Feel free to modify the script to implement other VLA models of your liking.

Inside your virtual environment, run:
```
python benchmark.py \
  --policy-type pi0 \
  --policy-path lerobot/pi0_base \
  --policy-from-hub \
  --run-all-tasks \
  --task-subset ID \
  --iterations 5 \
  --eval-follower-calib-dirs calibration/robots/so101_follower \
  --eval-follower-ports /dev/ttyACM1 \
  --eval-follower-ids so101_follower_arm \
  --eval-top-indexes 4 \
  --eval-wrist-indexes 14 \
  --reset-mode fixed \
  --reset-action-file arm_reset.json
```

| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `--policy-type <model>` | Selects the policy family to evaluate. Currently supported models: `{act,smolvla,dit,xvla,pi0,pi05,molmoact2}` |
| `--policy-path <path>` | Hugging Face repo ID or local path for the policy checkpoint. |
| `--policy-from-hub` | If `--policy-path` directs to a Hugging Face repo ID, include this flag. Loads policy from Hugging Face Hub instead of local directory. |
| `--run-all-tasks` | Runs evaluation across all 10 VLA-REPLICA tasks from task config, instead of single task. |
| `--task-subset <ID or OOD>` | When using `--run-all-tasks`, restricts evaluation to ID or OOD task subset. |
| `--iterations <number>` | Number of evaluation iterations per task (we used 5 in the paper). |
| `--eval-follower-calib-dirs <path>` | Follower calibration directory. (default: `calibration/robots/so101_follower`). |
| `--eval-follower-ports <serial port>` | Serial port for the follower robot (e.g. `dev/ttyACM1`) |
| `--eval-follower-ids <id>` | Robot ID for the follower arm. (default: `so101_follower_arm`) |
| `--eval-top-indexes <index>` | Top-camera index for the active arm. |
| `--eval-wrist-indexes <index>` | Wrist-camera index for the active arm. |
| `--reset-mode fixed` | Uses a fixed reset action instead of teleoperated leader reset (we enabled this for the paper). |
| `--reset-action-file <path>` | JSON file containing the normalized reset action vector required when `--reset-mode fixed` is used. (default: `arm_reset.json`) |

### MolmoAct2 SO-100/SO-101

MolmoAct2 uses AllenAI's `allenai/MolmoAct2-SO100_101` checkpoint directly through Transformers, so it works alongside the existing LeRobot 0.5.1 policies without replacing the installed LeRobot package. The first run downloads a large checkpoint (about 22 GB). On a 24 GB GPU, keep the default `bfloat16` mode and leave CUDA graphs disabled initially.

First run a dry test. This reads the real cameras and joint state, downloads and runs the model, and records/prints predicted actions without sending policy actions to the follower:

```
python benchmark.py \
  --policy-type molmoact2 \
  --task-id task_01 \
  --iterations 1 \
  --policy-seconds 30 \
  --eval-follower-calib-dirs calibration/robots/so101_follower \
  --eval-follower-ports /dev/ttyACM1 \
  --eval-follower-ids so101_follower_arm \
  --eval-top-indexes 4 \
  --eval-wrist-indexes 14 \
  --reset-mode fixed \
  --reset-action-file arm_reset.json \
  --molmoact2-dry-run
```

Replace the serial port and camera indexes with the values reported on your machine. The released checkpoint uses the old LeRobot v2.1 SO-100 degree convention. For MolmoAct2, the evaluator configures LeRobot's follower in degree mode and converts to and from current SO-101 v3 coordinates using the official defaults `--molmoact2-joint-signs 1,-1,1,1,1,1` and `--molmoact2-joint-offsets 0,90,90,0,0,0`. MolmoAct2 remains in dry-run mode by default even if `--molmoact2-dry-run` is omitted. After checking the recorded actions, pass `--molmoact2-enable-hardware-actions` to allow policy control. The conservative defaults execute one predicted action per inference and limit each commanded joint change to 3 degrees relative to the current state in both the adapter and robot driver. Increase these limits only after validating the setup; a per-step clamp limits speed but cannot prevent a series of commands from reaching the table.

MolmoAct2-specific options include `--molmoact2-dtype`, `--molmoact2-norm-tag`, `--molmoact2-num-steps`, `--molmoact2-actions-per-chunk`, `--molmoact2-enable-cuda-graph`, `--molmoact2-max-joint-step-deg`, `--molmoact2-joint-signs`, `--molmoact2-joint-offsets`, `--molmoact2-dry-run`, and `--molmoact2-enable-hardware-actions`.

## Evaluation process

1. After the script loads the corresponding policy and connects successfully to the followers, the follower arm will move to a consistent start position (predetermined in `arm_reset.json`). An openCV GUI will pop up, overlaying the live video feed from the top camera with the proper test scene (i.e. predefined object placements) for that task. 

2. Grab the corresponding objects needed for that scene (i.e. red plate and bread A for the first task) and then move the objects to their reference image positions so that the live camera and overlay image are identical to each other.

      </figure>

3. When the live video feed and overlay image match almost exactly, press `Enter` on the keyboard to start policy inference.
    * During policy evaluations for the VLA-REPLICA paper, each policy is given 90 seconds to complete the task before the iteration ends.  
    * If the policy completes the task before 90 seconds, press `right arrow (➜)` to skip to the setup phase of the next iteration. The SO-101 arm will reset back to the start position.
4. Log success and/or failure behavior for each iteration corresponding to that specific task. The full list of tasks and criteron are listed below.

## ID versus OOD evaluation

- ID tasks use scene layouts close to the training distribution to see how well the model learns.
    - There are 10 ID tasks total, with 5 variants each, for a total of __50 ID iterations__.
- OOD tasks test new colors, counts, or objects to test how well the model generalizes generalization.
    - There are 8 ID tasks total, with 5 variants each, for a total of __40 ID iterations__.
